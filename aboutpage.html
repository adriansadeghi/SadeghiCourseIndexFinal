	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>In this course I set out to apply my learnings from my previous year in this course, complimented with my self-taught knowledge obtained before the start of my official studies. The projects in this course posed a challenge to my reasonings<br>and ability to constitute visual coherence across an entire project while also connecting these visualities conceptually. Learning coding was instrumental to the completion in this course and in completing these projects I developed a sturdy<br>basis for HTML/CSS and p5.js coding. Overall, I had great fun dealing with these types of problems in a visual manner. Below is displayed some of my works from the past few years.</p>
