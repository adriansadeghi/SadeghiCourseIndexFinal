	<h1>Reading Discussion I</h1>
	<p>The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors<br>positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? 
<br><br>Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?

	<h2>My Response</h2>
	<p2 class="stage1para">In the first article author John-Patrick Hartnett expresses his concern about the duopoly that both Apple and Adobe hold over the graphic design industry. Hartnett is in favour of more accesible hardware and software which is evident<br>through his explanation that through seeking efficiency designers have allowed themselves to be held from their tools at a distance. Through reading this article it is fairly evident that Adobe have simplified workflows across their<br>applications, as well as integrating different digital features such as cloud storage in order to create a premium experience which users will break down the pay wall for. In the second article author Gavin Mueller delves into the politics<br>surrounding open-source software. Mueller opens his ideas through explaining that the true roots of personal computing are synonymous with open-source, that "cracking things open" and sharing what you learned as well as sharing<br>softwares themselves was a common trait within the community of personal computing. Mueller goes on to reflect on a statement made by Bill Gates in 1976 which entailed his awareness of software piracy, as well as his idea that<br>software piracy would result in nothing but a decrease in programmers willing to write code for software. It turned out that the majority of those involved with personal computing would disagree, seeing as their first times working with<br>code was likely studying and reverse-engineering softwares that had been shared with them. It is evident that Mueller is in the favour of open-source software as a method for sharing knowledge and improving software code on a<br>general basis. 
The Adobe suite provides a smooth workflow across apps at the cost of a monthly subscription, and as Hartnett explained, in a sense Adobe is always keeping designers tools at distance thus preventing greater influence.<br>It's evident in Mueller's text that through learning how each tools is actually founded and created, you can better understand the extremeties of which you can push that tool to. My connection is that if the Adobe suite were open-source<br>and everyone could crack open the code and learn the actual boundaries of each tool, not only would more people be able to create amazing things, but these people would no longer be relying on corporate entities.
Aside from the<br>mastery of digital & physical tools, I believe the most integral part of the graphic design practice is to actually interpret everything alongside its potential purpose in the circuit of creation. What I am explaining is not to only look at things<br>for their potential use, but to acknowledge it. As a designer I believe a extremely important trait is to be able to look at what you create as an outsider; someone on the street just glancing at your work. In addition, it is also extremely<br>important to understand the different ways that what your looking at can be interpreted. Funny enough, I also believe this to be a somewhat open-source view on things. To look at a chair but not label it as one; rather a collection of wood<br>or whatever the material may be. To simply allow yourself to be a vessel for interpretation.

Hi Adrian,
I really agree with what you had to say in response to question two. I absolutely think that putting yourself into the position of a viewer is one of the most important things one<br>can do in their design process- I think designers forget that their work will never exist to serve one single topic or idea. Our work is (mostly) created for consumption, and our audience<br>gets to decide what our intentions may or may not be! Not just us. I really enjoyed your analogy with the chair :)

 <h1>Reading Discussion II</h1>
	<p>What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. <br><br>What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).</p>

	<h2>My Response</h2>
	<p2 class="stage1para">I believe Lialina's definition of the universal user to be extremely important in understanding Schwulst's argument between individual websites and platforms. Lialina defines the universal user as someone who is often in a rush since<br>using your website is not always their main priority. The universal user is a general umbrella term which encapsulates the average user and their habits. This can be directly related to Schwulst's argument advocating for individual sites<br>once considering the way in which websites are engineered. The main difference between individual websites and platforms is how they are built and the people they are building it for. Those creating individual sites often take<br>consideration the experience of viewers from a variety of different backgrounds, while bigger platforms generally tend to cater to the 'universal user' in order to create a smooth experience for everyone. The downfall to catering to the<br>larger universal audience is you being to lose the integrity with which you treat their information, which has only become more apparent in recent history with platforms such as Google and Snapchat blatantly selling user's information.<br>
I resonated with Lialina's definition of the General purpose user; "users who have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device." (Lialina). What resonated with me is that I grew up using<br>a computer and even when I didin't understand what it did I would constantly push it's limits and see what I could get out of it. Eventually I would come across various forums for different genres of art and video games which would largely<br>inspire the creator I am today. The internet to me serves as another plane of existence where more is possible than in the real world.</p2>

Hi Adrian,
The experience of growing up using computers and finding your way around things resonates with me. I started using a computer before I knew how to read or write, so I couldn't read the directions<br>and install a game or learn the rules, I just clicked every button until I got my way and before I started elementary school I could use a computer and browsers without anyone help and even if I did things wrong<br>I still managed to find games online, use programs like paint, and store puppy pictures in PowerPoint slides.

<h1>Reading Discussion III</h1>
	<p>Van Rossum explores the visual, formal, and structural logic of older programmatic-looking artworks (pre-computer) in order to remake in current day languages (Python) and tools (Drawbot), because why not? By rethinking these static<br>artworks into motion that loops, JVR re-observes through the lens of new tools and languages. The artwork takes on a new life, and can delight in different ways. Find 1 example of design that you find fascinating and are confused as to<br>how it was made. Post a visual. Describe how you think it was made. Then find out how it actually was, written in point form. Make sure to cite!</p>

	<h2>My Response</h2>
	<p2 class="stage1para">Through watching "Math, Logic, Design?" with Just van Rossum it became strikingly clear to me the importance of understanding the way in which things have been created. In this video JVR displays his efforts in drawing context from<br>older artworks and reimplementing their essence through the use of new tools and means of communicating. A design which I find particularly fascinating is "Mills College Lecture Series" poster by Martin Venezky. When initally<br>observing this poster I interpereted some key elements which made up the poster; vectored typography, few vectored rudimentary shapes, an organized array of stars, as well as a multitude of small circles organized in a logical/mathe-<br>matical structure. My thinking as to how this poster was created is that the typography, the basic shapes and the logical structure of circles were set in illustrator however I am still not exactly sure about how Venezky would have gone<br>about arranging these circles. The glowing star-like elements appear very photoshop-esk and I presume that through careful tuning of outer glow and drop shadow values Venezky was able to adjust the overall presence of the star<br>element has in contrast to the logistical pattern sitting behind it. When further observing Venezky's project page I realised there to be supplied images focused breaking down what seems to be the different steps of the poster. Here lies<br>the isolated version of the stars, as well as a version combining the rudimentary shapes and the stars together, which could support my idea that they were seperately created in their respective softwares. After researching I came to<br>two main solutions for what Venezky has done here with his logical arrangement of small circles. Venezky may have used the halftone function in adobe illustrator to create a large array of dots however those tend to be restricted to being equally spaced</p2>

	<p2 class="stage1para">A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s<br>thought experiment.  
Surveillance as Hito Steyerl explains in his essay is understood as a trait of visuality that refers to a vertical, aerial view which is often captured by the likes of surveillance technologies such as Google maps, drones,<br>and various other tracking and targeting devices. This kind of visuality is modern in nature, seeing as Steyerl even states that this view is considered a "God's-eye view" (Steyerl). For a long time, humans have developed artistic styles<br>which innovate past the use of linear perspective, however the influence of modern technologies have enabled surveillance perspectives on a large scale. This modern visuality has great potential to lend itself useful to humanity moving<br>forward. For example, this new perspective may allow humans to map the vertical axis of territories worldwide more accurately. Unfortunately, while the access to this new visuality is revolutionary and provides a new perspective for humans<br>to consider the world through visually, there is still a dilemma with surveillance technologies. The greater areas of the world are captured through cameras which have been mounted onto boats and planes such as the google maps camera<br>would be attached to its respective car which drives around capturing its surroundings. While this is effective in covering large amounts of land and is crucial in the process of making something like Google Earth work so effectively, it falls<br>short in the sense that there is a serious lack of detail when looking in closer.
