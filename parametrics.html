	<h1>Parametrics & Generation</h1>
	<p>Throughout this project I was asked to create 21 code sketches. There are examples of abstract explorations which served <br>as a way for me to become closer with my tools and gain a deeper understanding of them throughout the project.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/OKz9b1e0Z"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>As the first code sketch I would attempt in my series, this “abstractOne” piece would<br>serve as the basic foundation of my experiments through plotting basic shapes<br>along various points of the x and y axis. In this stage also had minimal inputs through<br>the conventions of colour. The composition itself has little relation to the letter “D” of<br>which I was assigned by my professor.</p></div>
<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/SW2DMCtNs"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>This along with a few other sketches throughout my series were created in the 400x<br>400px format which is native to p5.js. These examples were created before any of my<br>1000x1000 pieces, and display much of my rougher of the works displayed. For the<br>purpose of display, I have resized their environments so all match. However, the<br>resolution of the sketches themselves stay preserved in the state they were created in.<br>“abstractTwo” serves as a continuation in exploring shapes and colour, this time exploring<br>how to assign and composite shapes around one another in this environment. I noticed<br>that like photoshop there are anchors to my shapes however they are just invisible. I did my<br>best to conceptualize shapes in these way to think about which points can be used to make<br>contact and join with other shapes. I explore that here.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/k5W5clGpO"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>In “abstractThree” I begin to push my idea previously explored in my second sketch,<br>static shape interaction. I played with the fill value of rotated overlapping squares<br>to better understand and experience how these shapes react when treated in this manner.</p></div>
<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/jKx8Dhmyf"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>“firstletterD” would be my first attempt at my assigned letter D. While very <br>basic I tried to connect to my roots in illustrator using the rectangle tool to keep<br>consistency in the strokes of a custom type of icon or logo. I tried to treat p5<br>like illustrator and arrange my shapes to fulfill my concept. </p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/H0dpUkJQH"></iframe>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/UWQ6dEH80"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>“thirdletterD” would act as my transition from just trying to construct a D and<br>making something visually interesting. At this point I had not learned many functions<br>and was honestly stumped as to where I could introduce a shocking factor to a<br>static image I couldn’t function quite well in just yet.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/GpG_hTN31"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>My “fourthletterD” would attempt to expand in the direction my last sketch left off<br>in search of. I separate my canvas into squares and assigned each respective<br>square a colour in order to portray a D. This was the beginning of not presenting<br>my letter so deliberately but instead through another means.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/emE7_8Rp_"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>This sketch is an experiment where in which I would discover the possibility to<br>interact with my sketch in real time, so my sketches were no longer stagnant<br>and static pieces. I used the click to draw function to test multiple different<br>combinations of shapes which would construct letters in different ways.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/RD7ctgBdX"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>At this point I wanted to explore the construction of another letter so I could<br>provide context to the construction of my own letter D. I was getting too wrapped<br>up in the construction of the letter itself and I found the E similar<br>enough to draw context from.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/_VyHk8IvK"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>My “scanningElipse” sketch would prove very experimental as it is minimal in<br>visual interest however in terms of functionality this type of movement was<br>something I was very happy about when I achieved it and opened many doors<br>in my mind when it came to developing these sketches.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/IESBSqf28"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>I would then rally up with “rotatingDPuzzle” which was another experiment that<br>I created through drawing inspiration from someone’s work I had seen in class.<br>When presenting they had shown a sketch of theirs where basic shapes would<br>relocate automatically and form a greater image. This was my initial<br>attempt at such an effect.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/SURyo9hFi"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>“clickToRotate” Is another venture in exploring how I can interact with my image<br>through using a mouse click as an input. This idea was expanded upon in my next sketch.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/L5QnaVfFs"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>“clickToHue” Is an application from few experiments and combines mouse clicking<br>as an input with a colour randomizing option which provides a random hue with<br>each of the user’s clicks.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/V87guNB4R"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>This sketch explores the possibility of multiple overlapping layers. My goal with<br>this sketch was to provide a sense of depth on the same shapes using timing<br>and colour. While all elements in the sketch revolve around the same point it<br>is obvious, they are separate entities moving at slightly different paces.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/8RgAGevYR"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>In this sketch I combined what I learned from random colour generators with<br>my abstract expression of the letter D. While somewhat static I find that<br>row-assigned colour ranges provide a sense of specificity to this<br>sketch otherwise unattainable.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/8O7qnxQQT"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>Before when constructing my 2D letter D I was unhappy with what I had created<br>and so this sketch serves as my second take. This expands on my idea of treating<br>p5 similar to Illustrator since I would often use different sized circles to connect<br>two perpendicular rectangles as displayed here.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/ICp-HRJUX"></iframe>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/8ct0dDyt4"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>This sketch serves as my exploration of combining the functions discovered<br>in the “scanningElipse” and  my attempt of abstracting the letter<br>D through shapes once again.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/KzvFFuOE_"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>“RotationforAssembly” explores the possibility of a sketch presenting itself as<br>both abstract and legible. When viewing this sketch it may seem confusing at<br>first but if you watch for a full cycle of its rotation you will catch an instance<br>where the greater image of the D is constructed. This expresses two purposes<br>as there is a depth for those who are consciously paying attention to this or if<br>you’re observing it in the background of an event for example.</p></div>

<iframe class="codesketches2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sadeghiadrian/full/XzasP10q5"></iframe><div class="codesketchtext"> <p>mousePressedColourGrid is a sketch that would prove pivotal to my<br>“negativeSpaceColourGridD” sketch. This exploration of row-based<br>colour ranges was instrumental to me building a similar system around<br>the shape of a letter D.</p></div>
